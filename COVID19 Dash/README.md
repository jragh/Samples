## COVID-19 Dashboard -> Using Dash By Plotly
The bulk of this repo is to house the COVID-19 Dashboard project. The dashboard is created inside of the **COVID19_Dash.py** file, while data extraction and data cleaning is handled by the **COVID19_Simple.py** and **COVID19_Diff.py** files. Currently the data extraction accesses 3 links hosted by John Hopkins University COVID19 data repository. Changes will be coming to these files to help optimize the speed of these extraction processes. 

js callbacks and the structuring of the app is handled by the Dash framework inside of the **COVID19_Dash.py** file.
